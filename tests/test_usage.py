"""Usage-overview shaping tests (PRD-18216).

No network calls: the wrapper's only own logic is `_shape_overview`, a pure
function over an already-fetched payload, so it is tested directly. The
no-credentials path is exercised through the registered tool with a
client_factory that returns None.

Why the truncation tests carry the weight here: the tool's output budget
(_json.MAX_CHARS) is smaller than a full page of `breakdown` at the API's
maximum pageSize, and the generic capper trims the largest list *silently*.
A model would then read a short breakdown next to a full `breakdownTotal`
and conclude it had seen every agent. AC7 forbids that state.
