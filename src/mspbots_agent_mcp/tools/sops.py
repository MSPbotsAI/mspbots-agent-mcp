"""SOP library: list the tenant's SOPs, and hold a synchronous turn with one.

A SOP (standard operating procedure) is a tenant-level record that owns its
own agent, provisioned for it when the SOP is created. That agent is what
mspbotsagent_chat_with_sop talks to, which is why the chat tool takes a
sop_id and never an agent_id.

Not to be confused with tools/sop_author.py: those edit the SOP *draft
sections* hanging off an agent (name / source / purpose / data sources /
procedure). This module reads the library and runs a conversation.
