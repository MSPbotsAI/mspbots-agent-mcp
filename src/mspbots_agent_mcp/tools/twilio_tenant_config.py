# GET/PATCH /api/agents/:id/twilio/tenant-config — the tenant-customizable
# SLICE of an agent's Twilio channel config (19 keys: greeting, language,
# idle/transfer behavior, tts, intake business-flow text). This is
# deliberately narrower than the full twilio block PUT /api/agents/:id
# accepts: system-level keys (credentials, recording, identity_* prompts,
# intake system prompt, speech model, event callbacks) are out of scope on
# this path — sending one is rejected, not silently ignored, and this
# endpoint never reveals or accepts a credential in the clear.
#
# PATCH is per-key and three-state, independently for each of the 19 keys:
# a key absent from the call leaves it untouched; null (or "" / [] for the
# collection-typed keys) clears it back to the channel default; a value
# writes it after server-side validation. A Python-level default of None
# can't distinguish "absent" from "explicit null" (both parse to None), so
# every optional field here defaults to the _UNSET sentinel instead —
# confirmed against a live FastMCP instance that this produces a clean
# optional JSON-schema entry (pydantic just omits the unserializable
# default rather than erroring) and that omitted/null/value all reach the
# tool body as distinguishable states.
